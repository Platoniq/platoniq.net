In a context of disaffection, polarisation and disinformation, young people want to be the new protagonists of politics and citizen participation. 

The School of Creativity and Democracy is a unique training space whose purpose is to provide young people with tools and experiences that promote democratic regeneration.

![Participante de IdeaCamp](/media/download-36.jpeg "Participante de IdeaCamp")

Citizen participation is both an indicator of democratic health, active citizenship and political engagement in public affairs that affect society as a whole.

Through creativity and defending citizens' right to participation, we promote the recovery of the affective legitimacy of democracy. 

**What are we aiming for?**

Our aim is nothing less than to build a political culture that touches the heart, based on the idea of affective legitimacy. Focusing on creativity and citizen participation as key elements in the design of public policies, the School is especially aimed at people aged 18 to 35.

* **To train future deliberation professionals in the values of participation,** creativity and mutual trust.
* **To provide participatory experiences** where the knowledge acquired can be put into practice with social impact.
* **To open a space for experimentation** where concerns and skills can be shared.

**Who is our target audience?**

The School of Creativity and Democracy is specially designed **to complement those studies related to political science, sociology, philosophy, programming, communication and qualitative research, always focused on citizen advocacy,** with the aim of providing living examples of participation and relaunching deliberative democracy in Spain.  

To this end, we have designed four itineraries that respond to four profiles:

* **facilitation**
* **digital participation**
* **creative research**
* **citizen communication**

**What are we offering?**

We are doing a lot of exciting things to strengthen democracy and get young people more involved in decision-making. For example, we work with civic groups and experts to monitor what happens in citizens' assemblies and make sure those results are heard in real politics.

![Itinerario ECD](/media/captura-de-pantalla-2024-09-06-a-las-12.08.36.png "Itinerario ECD")

Practical training, with some touches of theory. Thinking, debating and being able to propose measures for complex problems. Learning to evaluate arguments and make decisions together. With this **learning by doing** programme we train a new generation committed to continuous participation.

Emphasising real experiences of participation that are being carried out at the moment, **we offer direct contact with the problems and opportunities of participation,** searching for new creative solutions so that citizens' recommendations end up having an impact on real public policies that change the lives of people and communities.

{% quote { "author": "Katy Rubin, experta en Teatro Legislativo" } %}We need to have analysis, dialogue, interaction, and improvisation to turn the emotional release into a practical intervention, such as policies or practices. {% endquote %}

\-

We also organise campaigns to make young people's ideas really matter in government and to express themselves and be heard in society. In addition, we are creating training programmes that teach how other forms of democracy work and how to be part of them.

In addition to direct contact with experiences of participation, the School will provide participants with a **podcast on deliberation** where they can talk about the most relevant issues of the moment with professionals or activists involved in the latest citizen advocacy campaigns in our country, a **digital platform for participation** where they can learn and rehearse from the inside the skills needed to energise dialogues and citizen assemblies and the **[Wilder Journal,](https://journal.platoniq.net/en/wilder-journal-2/)** a space to publish the testimonies and reflections of the participants during and after their time at the School.

Y eso no es todo! Estamos experimentando con nuevas formas de juntar a la gente y que se sientan inspirados para compartir sus ideas y colaborar. Y para que todo esto llegue a más personas, estamos usando internet y las redes sociales para difundir información interesante y promover el diálogo abierto.

##### Aprendizajes y oportunidades profesionales

Para cada uno de los perfiles previstos hemos diseñado un itinerario de capacitación que conseguirá que los participantes de la escuela puedan enfocarse de manera profesionalizada a la participación ciudadana, así como desarrollen sus habilidades creativas en cada uno de sus ámbitos de acción.
