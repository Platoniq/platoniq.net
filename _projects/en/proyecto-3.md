\## How do we do it?

Think, debate and be able to propose measures for complex problems. Learn to evaluate arguments and make decisions together. With this ‘learning by doing’ programme we train a new generation committed to continuous participation.

{% quote %}We need analysis, dialogue, interaction and improvisation to turn emotional release into practical intervention.{% endquote %}

\--Katy Rubin, Legislative Theatre Expert

\## Project activities

We are doing lots of exciting things to strengthen democracy and get young people more involved in decision-making. For example, we work with civic groups and experts to monitor what happens at citizens' assemblies and make sure those results are heard in real politics.

We also organise campaigns to make sure that young people's ideas really matter in government and to express themselves and be heard in society. In addition, we are creating training programmes that teach how other forms of democracy work and how to be part of them.

And that's not all! We are experimenting with new ways of bringing people together and inspiring them to share their ideas and collaborate. And to bring all this to more people, we are using the internet and social media to spread interesting information and promote open dialogue.

We are very excited to launch the ‘School for Creativity and Democracy’, where you can learn and participate in creative activities that will help you become an agent of change in your community. We hope you will join us in this exciting adventure!
