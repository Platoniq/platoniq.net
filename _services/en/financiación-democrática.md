Goteo is a **crowdfunding** site that focuses on projects that, in addition to granting individual rewards, also generate a collective return through **the promotion of the commons, open source software and/or free content.**

So far, the dynamics of the so-called Giving 2.0 have mostly been in the social environment. Platoniq seeks to transfer this model to the field of cultural innovation. We can say that innovation today consists of the development and exploitation of new ideas that satisfy valuable objectives. And these objectives are not only economic or technological, but increasingly include **social and cultural objectives.**

{% metrics { "items": [{"text":"Money raised","number":"21M"},{"text":"Successfull projects","number":"83,8%"},{"text":"Comunity","number":"355k"}] } %}

# How do we achieve this?

* Goteo is a **project incubator** that produces and connects good ideas with the contexts that need them;
* an online social network that enables micro-donations from the cultural public, institutions and companies to the innovative projects of their choice: an **alternative way of financing** in line with the new digital models;
* an **efficient, open and productive platform** capable of connecting cultural creators with the people of their community: a meeting point for citizen participation in future cultural agendas;
* a **national benchmark** for distributed cultural innovation.

# Goteo as a social network 

Introducing new forms of collaborative economy in the emerging creative sector is a way to create **cultural innovation.** It is necessary to generate a change in the established system and give creators and cultural producers the possibility of obtaining resources, not only through traditional funding channels (generally public entities), but also through their own community and private organisations, which, through small donations to the creators of their choice, would make it possible to increase the creative fabric in their environment and, in the long run, a greater number of collaborations between the cultural, social, technological and economic spheres.

Crowdcoop is a crowdfunding platform specialising in cooperatives and their particular needs. Or as we like to call it: the new cooperative project factory for a more social and sustainable economy.

On the one hand, cooperatives get advice and training to boost their projects and create a community around them. On the other hand, through crowdfunding, cooperatives can find the support and sponsorship they need to create their project, make it known and consolidate it.

It is a transparent funding channel that reactivates the co-responsible role of civil society, provides legitimacy and enables the viability of the project to be assessed by its community. All with the aim and priority of serving the cooperative world and the social economy, sharing the values and philosophy of cooperativism that contributes to social justice. In addition, at **Crowdcoop** we streamline cooperative financing with a digital platform that strengthens the relationship with future members.
