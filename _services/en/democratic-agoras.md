The aim of this service is **to link the values and stories of an organisation with those of the general public.**

Through the use of a digital platform for democratic participation, we bring out the collective intelligence to build, together with the citizens, a new field of meanings, broad and plural, **open to the proposals of all people.**

The Democratic Agora model integrates **both the physical and digital dimensions.** In other words, meetings between people give rise to specific proposals that are then discussed online on the platform, **which end up becoming a roadmap agreed with the citizens.**

# How do we achieve this?

* Creating self-managed spaces for dialogue or deliberation on a specific topic, in order to elaborate joint and specific proposals.
* Offering a digital space where to collect and prioritise the proposals made in the different Agoras.
* Accompanying in the process of elaboration of electoral programmes (political parties), strategic lines (organisations) or a set of political proposals resulting from the participatory process.

# Methodology highlighted

Our aim is to create Agoras that are able to facilitate the participation of all people present without discrimination of origin, gender, class, age, disability, sexual orientation or creed. To this end, as organisers of an Agora, it is our responsibility **to promote spaces that are as inclusive as possible, allowing for the participation of all people.**

Considering the **barriers** that participants may face and assessing what impact the Agora may have on each of them, we have designed a methodology on the creation of **inclusive spaces** that considers possible physical or symbolic difficulties, both in online and offline environments.[](https://agorademocratiche-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/agora-democratiche-staging/uploads/decidim/attachment/file/156/Manuale_su_come_organizzare_eventi_pi%C3%B9_inclusivi.pdf)

To find out how we apply this methodology, you can consult the experience we carried out with the [Italian Democratic Party](https://platoniq.net/es/projects/agora-democratica-pd/) in 2021 to decide, together with their partners, what became their political programme.
