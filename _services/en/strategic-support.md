Strategic planning is the tool used by organisations to **diagnose, analyse, reflect and make decisions** about their objectives and the focus of their future activities, in order to adapt to the changes and demands of the environment in accordance with their raison d'Ãªtre.

Through strategic planning we not only adapt to the environment, but also create our **desired future,** as an internal organisation and with our social objectives fulfilled.

# How do we achieve this?

* We help identify the internal and external factors that condition the development of organisations
* We provide tools that enable the definition of the organisation's major challenges, strategic objectives and medium and long-term results
* We co-design future actions and activities that can realistically be carried out with the resources and internal organisation available
* We co-create inspiring narratives of the future so that the community is able to accompany along the way
* We set up impact monitoring and evaluation systems that allow us to measure the level of achievement of milestones and objectives

# Methodology highlighted

At FundaciÃ³n Platoniq we not only use the **main strategic planning methodologies**: PESTEL, SWOT, OKR, in-depth interviews or the definition of mission, vision and values.

We also apply **creativity** to the whole process by generating **our own methodologies,** such as the hero's journey, mountain climbing or the visualisation of universes (see image ðŸ‘‡) to give us the opportunity to think beyond, identify the organisation's strengths and define some of the most important milestones to take into account when we decide to embark on this journey.

The FundaciÃ³ Pare Manel entrusted the drafting of its Strategic Plan to the FundaciÃ³ Platoniq in 2023 (consult the project in detail here). According to them, and after four months of work with all the workers, these were some of the **conclusions** they reached to initiate a process of participatory strategic accompaniment:

* To obtain a **more democratic process.**
* To **integrate multiple perspectives,** taking advantage of the potential of the collective intelligence of the participants.
* To **strengthen the team's sense** of belonging to the organisation.
* To have more **transversal knowledge** of the Pare Manel Foundation, its interest groups, areas of work and functioning.
* To be more agile in **detecting opportunities,** classify them in order of priority and be able to exploit them.
* To provide a solid base and a living methodological legacy, **adaptable and anticipated** to the different needs that may fluctuate over time.
