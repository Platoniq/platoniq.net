A media literacy project that aims to help young people learn how **to combat misinformation.** The project brings together organisations including libraries, media literacy organisations and research institutes to develop, test and measure the impact of an innovative educational approach to combat the spread of misinformation.

**We invite you to join Platoniq's international media literacy project.** Through this project, you will acquire tools, skills and knowledge to recognise and combat misinformation, and transfer this knowledge to young people aged 12-15 through specialised workshops.

# How do we achieve this?

**1st Phase. Preliminary research**

The aim of this part is to map, record and take stock of the different types of tools, resources, campaigns and workshops developed to inform and educate young people about digital disinformation in Spain. The aim is to learn about different approaches, specifically in Spain, to develop new interventions that provide young people with new knowledge and tools to resist and dismantle disinformation.

**2nd Phase. Training for teachers and librarians**

The training is aimed at library staff and secondary school teachers, who have basic skills around digital learning and digital literacy ([INFORMATION FOR SCHOOL AND LIBRARIES](https://smiles.platoniq.net/uploads/decidim/attachment/file/123/SMILES_School_and_Library_v1_0_EN.pdf))

The training will last two days and will equip participants with the knowledge, skills and tools necessary to conduct a workshop on misinformation in the classroom.

After the training, pairs of teachers and librarians will be formed to work together to implement the workshops with students. As additional support, a handbook and a digital toolkit will be made available to participants. The training will take place in September 2022.

**3rd Phase. Content for students**

In the workshops, students will learn to critically reflect on the news presented to them in order to recognise and combat misinformation.

The workshops are aimed at young people aged between 12 and 15, with a special focus on those from the most vulnerable backgrounds. Two workshops per school, in two groups of a minimum of 20 students, will be held between October and November 2022. The aim is that libraries and schools can continue to work together in this area after the workshops.

**Phase 4. [Final report](https://smiles.platoniq.net/uploads/decidim/attachment/file/100/Baseline_study_-_Country_report_Spain-EN_v1.1.pdf)**

The effects of the workshops will be extensively measured and analysed. Attention will also be paid to possible differences between the education systems and cultures of the participating countries. Teachers, librarians and students will be involved in the impact measurement. Permission will be sought for the use of the data.

# Methodology highlighted

It highlights the legacy of this type of training on schools, colleges and libraries. The training, workshops, trainer's manual, digital toolkit and impact measurement are available free of charge to participating schools and libraries. 

At the end of the project, the material can be used by other groups of students in the same school as well as in other schools. In addition, the results of the impact measurement at institutional level are shared with teaching and library staff, students and participating organisations.
