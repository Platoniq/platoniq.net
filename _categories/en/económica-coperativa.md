subtitle: >-
  We are pioneers in strengthening the Social and Solidarity Economy by
  promoting ethical financing and civic crowdfunding. 


  We work for collective financial autonomy, opening up frameworks for collaboration between citizen projects and public and private institutions. 


  We support the dissemination, training and possible funding channels for all those initiatives that work for inclusion, recognition and the promotion of autonomy, both personal and collective.
