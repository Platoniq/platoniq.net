title: Future Culture
subtitle: >-
  We have extensive experience developing visionary courses and workshops that
  make us imagine and project a more ethical and desirable future. Through
  culture, research and art we foster citizen dialogue and social
  transformation, combining online and face-to-face formats that put creativity
  at the heart of public policy design. 


  This is how we prepare young people for democratic renewal, through alternative practices and new cultural strategies. Yes, we want to broaden democracy, and we want to do it in a way that anyone can feel part of it.
