title: Inclusive Democratic Innovation
subtitle: >-
  For more than twenty years we have been promoting democratic innovation
  through open participation experiences at the service of communities. 


  By combining digital tools and analogue methodologies, we work to improve the quality of public institutions by adding the voice of citizens. 


  We know that there is still a lot to do, enough to keep imagining new forms of citizen involvement that help us to build more robust and respectful frameworks for coexistence.
