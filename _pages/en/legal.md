The page that establishes the link may not state in any way that FUNDACIÓN PLATONIQ has authorised such a link, unless this has been done expressly and in writing.

**PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF PARTICIPATION (COMMENTS)**

FUNDACIÓN PLATONIQ wishes to encourage the participation of users through comments on the contents published on the website, always under a quality requirement that excludes insults, disqualifications and considerations unrelated to the subject in question. The aim is to offer users a platform for debate and discussion based on the following principles

We welcome all user comments that contribute to enriching the content and quality of the website and that help us to improve.

Disagreement, contrasting opinions and criticism are basic elements of debate. Insults, personal attacks, disqualifications or any expression or content that departs from the correct channels of discussion have no place, whether they are directed against the authors or protagonists of the articles or against other registered users.

We reject insulting, xenophobic, racist, homophobic, defamatory or any other kind of opinions that are considered unacceptable.

The editorial management will decide which content is open for comments. This selection will be made on the basis of newsworthiness and whenever it is possible to manage quality moderation. The list of content open for comment aims to be as broad as possible and to be constantly updated.

Advertising messages or messages on issues not related to the subject of the article in question will be rejected.

FUNDACIÓN PLATONIQ reserves the right to delete, without prior notice, comments that may be considered inappropriate. Each user is the only person legally responsible for his or her interventions through the participation spaces and, consequently, to exercise the legal actions that he or she deems appropriate.
