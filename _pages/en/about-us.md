Platoniq was born with the aim of spreading the right to a free culture and the democratisation of the media. Together with the lawyer Abel Garriga, we created the first free licence in Spain, under the name Aire Incondicional. From this stage we highlight the Burn Station project, a system for the distribution of music and radio programmes under copyleft licences in public spaces. With it we developed our first open source software for the distribution of free content. It was replicated and adapted in schools and on several continents.

A few years later, our driving force became the creation and sharing of free knowledge. With the Bank of Common Knowledge (2006-2009), we generated dynamics of exchange and collective production around the free transmission of knowledge and mutual education. We created the first temporary citizen laboratory spaces with pioneering participation and co-creation methodologies.

Our work was internationally recognised, receiving an honourable mention at the UNESCO Digital Arts Awards (France, 2005), the Festival de Cultura Digital Transmediale in Berlin (2006, Germany) where we won second prize with the project Burn Station and at the Festival Internacional de Artes Electrónicas y Video Transitio_MX in Mexico D.F. (2007, Mexico) when we received the Transnational Communities Award.

In this first stage, Platoniq managed to position itself as a pioneering organisation in the design of tools for citizen emancipation and social innovation, disseminated in innovation congresses and digital culture festivals and implemented in organisations such as the Mondragón Group in the Basque Country and a multitude of educational spaces in Europe, Asia and Latin America.

After a stage of distribution and knowledge creation and exchange, the next cycle had to address the problems of sustainability and financing of activities and projects with a social impact. And that is how Goteo.org was born, an incubator that produces and connects good ideas with the contexts that need them and a platform that makes them a reality through crowdfunding. 

The two organisations have been a driving force and vanguard in their field, inspiring many other initiatives and leading the way through creativity and innovation.

In 2021, a new stage begins with the merger of both projects, becoming Platoniq Foundation. Our teams are united, as are our challenges and objectives. At this juncture, moreover, the urgency to act with the conviction that the metamorphosis towards a more democratic, fair and equitable society is possible is revealed to us. 

We need to make it a reality so that it ceases to be a utopia.
